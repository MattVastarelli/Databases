### About

An implementation of a T-SQL database focused on combat sports. The database was primarily designed to easily calculate and find relevant statistics not yet available in the world of combat sports. 
***
Secondary to the creation of relevant statistics the database was designed in a general fashion so it could be abstracted to hold most relevant information about combat sports. The design is able to handle data about promotions or fights thus it could be used for other tasks. These tasks may include but are not limited to running a high school wrestling program or athletic department.
